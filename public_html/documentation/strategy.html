<h1>Content strategy & Wireframes</h1>

<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>A brief one-line introduction that clearly states my name and shows a direct idea of what my site with entail. A nice food image in the background.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>This section will detail my start of how the buisness became to be. I will also showcase and educate the fresh local ingredients that are used in the meals.</p>

<h2>Portfolio</h2>
<p>I want to show an example photo of the prepared meals offered. Possibly 4-6 to start. This would also include the name of the dish and the description, as well as the cost. </p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>This section will contain a basic contact form where you would also be able to place your order for the meals. </p>
